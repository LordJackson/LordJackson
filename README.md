- COMMON SENSE.



- I am an aspiring front-end developer, I've studied computer science, on and off, for 10 years. 
- I am giving tech my full attention everyday. I am committed to a brighter future for the world through tech.
- I am trying to give myself the skills to put food on my families table. My daughter, Stella, will be in the world in July 2025.
- I am trying to connect to a network of likeminded individuals. 
- I am studying Java, JavaScript, React Native, C++, HTML, CSS, SQL, Relational Databases, GUI programming.

- We must work together to better the space of development.
- We must share our ideas and thoughts in a constructive way.
- Everyone deserves respect until they prove otherwise.
